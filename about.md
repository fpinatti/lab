I'm Fabio Pinatti, Brazilian, married with the most amazing wife I could have and father of the two cutest children in the earth.

I work with frontend and motion design since rock ages, with more than 20 years of expertise,  coming from Visual Basic apps, Flash/Actionscript and currently all the trending frontend stuff, like HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.  I work as a designer as well, designing interfaces for digital products.

My mission is connect the tips, since the conception of a project, until its completion, delivering the best solutions for the final user.

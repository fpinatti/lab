I"z<p>Iâ€™m Fabio Pinatti, Brazilian, married with the most amazing wife I could have and father of the two cutest children in the galaxy.</p>

<p>I work with frontend and motion design since the Stone Age, more than 20 years of expertise,  coming from Visual Basic apps, Flash/Actionscript and currently all the trending frontend stuff, like HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.  I work as a designer as well, designing/prototyping interfaces for digital products.</p>

<p>My mission is connect the parts, since the conception of a project, until its completion, delivering the best solutions for the final user.</p>
